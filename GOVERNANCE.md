# Governance (Delegated)

This project defers day‑to‑day and strategic governance to the organization‑wide processes.

Authoritative sources:
- Organization governance & policies: https://github.com/sunflower-works/.github
- Security / vulnerability reporting: Refer to the SECURITY or org-level policy above.
- Code of Conduct: See org-level Code of Conduct (no local copy to avoid drift).
- Contribution workflow: See CONTRIBUTING guide at org level.

Local scope:
- This repository maintains only technical code, tests, and build/packaging assets.
- Decisions specific to this codebase (API changes, release cadence) are discussed via GitHub Issues / PRs and follow org escalation if consensus is not reached.
- Versioning: Pre-v1 experimental; expect breaking changes. Semantic versioning will apply starting with v1.0.0 of the extracted `vision-core` (future plan).

If a governance concern appears unaddressed here, escalate using the organization channels rather than adding ad-hoc local policy.
